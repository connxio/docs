# Adapters

An adapter in Connxio is a protocol-specific component that enables seamless integration between systems. It acts as a bridge, facilitating the exchange of data or files between a sender and a receiver system. Each adapter supports a particular protocol, such as API, Azure Blob Storage, Email etc. By configuring inbound and outbound adapters, users can define the source from which the file is received and the destination where it is sent. Adapters play a crucial role in ensuring smooth and reliable data flow, allowing users to connect and synchronize diverse systems effortlessly.

Check out the list of adapters supported by Connxio below:
