# User Management

User accounts are needed to access the ConnXio Portal. The user account allows a user to access the companies and subscriptions that the user has access to. 

Access in ConnXio is split up into companies and subscriptions. A user can have access to one or more subscriptions using the same login information.
The active subscription is selected in the dropdown menu at the top of the screen.

There are three different roles of users.
- User
- Administrator
- Owner

A user has access to the subscriptions specified in the "Subscriptions" dropdown menu. 
Administrator and Owners have full access to all subscriptions in the company.

## Access rights
Users with the "User" role can have one of three different access right.

- **Read** (Users can view information about Integrations, Code Components and Security Configurations)
- **Create or update** (Users can create and update Integrations, Code Components and Security Configurations)
- **Delete** (Users can delete Integrations, Code Components and Security Configurations)

## Inviting users
To invite more users into a subscription, you'll need to have the **Administrator** or **Owner** role. On the Users page, click **Invite users** and invite users by inputting their email address.
