Connxio, developed by Evidi, is a powerful integration platform designed to facilitate seamless data and file exchange between two systems. It enables users to establish connections, known as integrations, between a sender and a receiver system. Connxio supports a wide range of protocols, referred to as Adapters, to accommodate various integration scenarios.

### Key Features
- üí™ Flexible Integration Setup: Connxio provides a user-friendly web portal with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy configuration of integrations.
- ü§ñ Diverse Adapter Support: Connxio supports the following protocols for integration setups:
   - API/Webhook
   - Azure Storage (Blob, File, Table, Queue)
   - Email
   - Azure Event Grid
   - REST (Polling)
   - Azure Service Bus
   - FTP & SFTP
- üêß Extensive Transformation Capabilities: Connxio allows users to define file transformations to manipulate data during the integration process. The available transformations include:
   - Code Components: Enables mapping with custom code implemented in a .NET library uploaded as a .dll file.
   - Batching: Combines one or more files into a larger file using a specific batching interface implementation.
   - Splitting: Divides a larger file into multiple smaller files using a splitting-specific interface implementation.
   - Format Conversion: Converts files between JSON and XML formats.
   - Prettify: Enhances the readability of JSON or XML files.
