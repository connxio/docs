Connxio, by Evidi, is a powerful integration platform designed to facilitate seamless data and file exchange between systems. It enables users to establish connections, known as integrations, between a sender and a receiver system. Connxio supports a wide range of protocols, referred to as Adapters, to accommodate various integration scenarios.

Before starting to use Connxio, you should read about [why we created Connxio](./getting-started/why-connxio) and some of the [core concepts behind it](./getting-started/core-concepts).
