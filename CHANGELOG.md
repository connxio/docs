# ConnXio Changelog

## 2.0.0 (2024-03-01)

#### :rocket: New Features

> These are upcoming changes that will go into production in early 2024. More details will be added to the changelog continuously until release.

- `New Inbound engine`
  - Work has started on a totally new architecture for the Inbound CX Engine which handles all inbound adapters. This new architecture will add performance, continuous fetch from Queues and cron expressions for polling adapters.
  - The new architecture uses Microsoft Orleans and adds both separation and scaling beyond what was possible in the old engine.
  - The IP's for CX will change when the new engine is deployed. We will be sending e-mails and warning way in advance for all affected customers.
- `New Mapping Engine`
  - Mapping is being moved into a new engine. This will add better security and lets us manage mappings in a more streamlined way.
- `New queue handling between engines`
  - All engines including Transformation, Splitting, Logging and Batching are being upgraded to .net 6 and are being rewritten to use a new mode of transport between engines.
  - This enabled better performance and a more robust engine.
- `Blue green architecture`
  - ConnXio is being moved into a new environment and will be running a blue green architecture pattern. This will give you a smoother deployment experience and a far more robust and performant product.
