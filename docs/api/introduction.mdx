# Connxio API


The Connxio API is a comprehensive interface that allows users to interact programmatically with the Connxio platform.
It provides a range of endpoints and functionalities to facilitate integration management, messaging, and configuration operations.
With the Connxio API, users can create and manage integrations, retrieve integration details, perform CRUD operations on integration configurations, 
and retrieve information about subscriptions linked to their account.


The API enables seamless integration with external systems, allowing users to automate and streamline their integration processes.
By leveraging the Connxio API, users gain flexibility, scalability, and the ability to integrate Connxio functionalities into their own applications and workflows.
Proper authentication and authorization measures must be implemented to ensure secure access and data protection.

The various APIs are documented in the sections below:
- [Authentication](/api/authentication)
- [Messaging API](/api/messaging-api/introduction)
- [Management API](/api/management-api/introduction)
- [Resending API](/api/resending-api)
