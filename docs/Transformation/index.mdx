# Transformations
A transformation refers to the process of modifying or adapting data to suit specific integration requirements. It allows users to manipulate, reformat, or convert data as needed, ensuring compatibility and seamless communication between systems. Connxio supports a variety of transformations, including but not limited to:

- Code Components: Custom mapping and data manipulation using a .NET library uploaded as a .dll file.
- Batching: Combining one or more files into a larger file using a specific batching interface implementation.
- Splitting: Dividing a larger file into multiple smaller files using a splitting-specific interface implementation.
- Format Conversion: Converting files between different formats, such as JSON to XML or vice versa.
- Prettify: Enhancing the readability of JSON or XML files for easier interpretation and analysis.

By applying these transformations, Connxio empowers users to shape data according to their unique needs, facilitating smooth and reliable integrations while maintaining data integrity.
