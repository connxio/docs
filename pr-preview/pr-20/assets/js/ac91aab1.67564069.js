SFTP has problems with handling a lot of connections at the same time and will, in many circumstances, shut down completely when overwhelmed. All this culminates in a very unstable server connection which we handle in every way possible. We have used an enormous amount of resources to make our SFTP adapter as stable as possible since we know our customers have legacy systems that demands this protocol.
