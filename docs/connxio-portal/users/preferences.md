## Two-Factor Authentication
Users can turn on two-factor authentication in the user preferences page. New users will automatically have two-factor enabled. When enabled users will receive a time-based one-time password (TOTP) to their registered email address. This code is valid for 3 minutes.

If you have two-factor login enabled on your account, and you aren't receiving emails with a token, please contact <a href="mailto:support@connxio.no">support@connxio.no</a>.
