### Configuring Inbound and Outbound Adapters
An integration in Connxio involves configuring both an inbound and an outbound adapter. The inbound adapter determines where the file will be received from, while the outbound adapter determines where the file will be sent. Follow these steps to configure the adapters:
1. Select the inbound adapter from the available list of supported adapters, such as API/Webhook, Azure Blob Storage, Email, etc.
2. Configure the necessary settings and credentials for the selected inbound adapter.
3. Similarly, select the outbound adapter and configure its settings based on the target system's requirements.
