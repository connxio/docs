# Transformations
In Connxio, a transformation refers to the process of modifying or manipulating data during the integration workflow. Transformations allow users to customize and shape the data according to specific requirements. Connxio provides various transformation options, such as code components, batching, splitting, format conversion, and prettifying. Code components allow for custom mapping and data manipulation using .NET libraries. Batching combines multiple files into a larger file, while splitting divides a larger file into smaller ones. Format conversion transforms data between JSON and XML formats, and prettifying enhances the readability of JSON or XML files. Transformations empower users to streamline data handling and ensure compatibility between systems.
