# Integrations

This page will help to guide you through all the different options available to you when creating an integration. 

## Key Concepts

1. **[Configuration](/integrations/configuration)**: Integrations in Connxio must be configured with the required settings and parameters. You can configure integrations using the Connxio web interface or the [Management API](/api/management-api/introduction). Connxio supports various configuration options, such as input/output settings, data transformations, and logging.

2. **[Adapters](/integrations/adapters/introduction)**: Adapters in Connxio are protocol-specific components that facilitate integration between systems. Connxio supports a wide range of adapters, including API/Webhook, Azure Blob Storage, Email, FTP/SFTP, and more. Each adapter represents a different way of sending or receiving data.

3. **[Transformations](/integrations/transformation/introduction)**: Connxio allows you to modify and transform data during the integration process. Transformations enable you to manipulate, reformat, or convert data to meet specific requirements. Connxio supports various transformations, such as code components, batching, splitting, format conversion, and prettifying.

4. **[Logging](/integrations/logging)**: Connxio provides comprehensive logging capabilities to track the flow of data during integrations. You can monitor the execution of integrations, view logs for each step, and identify any errors or issues that occur. Logging helps with troubleshooting and ensuring the smooth operation of your integrations.

5. **[Testing](/integrations/testing)**: Connxio offers testing features that allow you to validate your integrations before deploying them in production. You can create test groups, define input files for each integration, and initiate test runs to simulate real-world scenarios. Test results help you identify any issues and ensure the correctness of your integration configurations.

## Additional Features

In addition to the key concepts mentioned above, Connxio also provides the following features:

- **Security**: Connxio prioritizes the security of your data and integrations. It employs encryption protocols and industry-standard security practices to safeguard sensitive information.

- **Load Testing**: Connxio allows you to perform load testing to assess the performance and scalability of your integrations. You can simulate high volumes of data to evaluate how your systems handle the increased workload.

For detailed information and instructions on using Connxio, refer to the specific sections in the Connxio documentation. Each concept and feature is explained in detail, along with step-by-step instructions and best practices.

We hope this overview provides you with a solid understanding of Connxio's core concepts and features. Feel free to explore the Connxio documentation further to dive deeper into each topic and harness the full potential of Connxio for your integration needs.

Happy integrating with Connxio!
